# axel-youtube-downloader
V2 of my youtube downloader script (deprecated) 

An unfinished and deprecated youtube download script. Uses a combination of youtube-dl and axel download accelerator, to download youtube videos. Since youtube-dl download speeds incredibly slow, youtube-dl is used to get the download urls of a video or playlist, then those urls are passed into axel to actually download the videos, resulting in a drastic speed improvement. Since axel has a limit to the length of a url that can be passed in, and since youtube download links from youtube-dl tend to exceed this limit; I implemented a local server running on `127.0.0.1:8000` (default) to shorten and redirect the urls so they can be passed into axel for downloading. Downloads are kept as subproccess and progress can be viewed by selecting them while the program is running. User editable variables within the download script can be edited to specify url, redirection port, and download format.

This program is unfinished as the download speed issue was fixed by yt-dlp (a youtube-dl fork), they even allow you to use a external downloader such as axel. Thus this program became obsolete was deprecated in favor of creating V3 which is a simpler bash script that utilizes yt-dlp.
